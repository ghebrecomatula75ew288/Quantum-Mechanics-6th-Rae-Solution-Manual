* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-1482299182
  * * Author: Alastair I.M. Rae
   
  * A Thorough Update of One of the Most Highly Regarded Textbooks on Quantum Mechanics
 
  * Continuing to offer an exceptionally clear, up-to-date treatment of the subject, Quantum Mechanics, Sixth Edition explains the concepts of quantum mechanics for undergraduate students in physics and related disciplines and provides the foundation necessary for other specialized courses. This sixth edition builds on its highly praised predecessors to make the text even more accessible to a wider audience. It is now divided into five parts that separately cover broad topics suitable for any general course on quantum mechanics.
